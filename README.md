## üìò Project Overview

**Objective:**  
The goal is to predict the successful landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage using publicly available data and machine learning models. Since reusability of the first stage significantly reduces launch costs (from approximately $165M to $62M), predicting its success is economically valuable.

## ‚ùì Key Questions

- How do variables such as **payload mass**, **launch site**, **number of previous flights**, and **orbit type** influence first stage landing success?  
- Has the success rate of landings improved over the years?  
- What is the best classification algorithm for predicting landing outcomes?

## ‚úÖ Conclusions

- The **Decision Tree model** outperforms other algorithms and proves to be the most suitable for predicting Falcon 9 first stage landing success on this dataset.  
- Launches with **lower payload masses** tend to achieve higher success rates compared to those carrying heavier payloads, highlighting the impact of payload weight on landing outcomes.  
- Most **launch sites are located near the Equator and close to coastal regions**, likely chosen to optimize launch logistics and enhance safety measures.  
- The **success rate of launches has improved steadily over the years**, reflecting continuous advancements in SpaceX‚Äôs technology and operational processes.  
- The **Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (KSC LC-39A)** exhibits the highest success rate among all analyzed launch sites.  
- Missions targeting **ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO orbits** have achieved a **100% success rate**, demonstrating exceptional reliability for these orbital destinations.
